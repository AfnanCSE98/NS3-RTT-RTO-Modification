# NS3-RTT-RTO-Modification
NS3 is an open-source event-driven simulator designed specifically for research
in computer communication networks. In this project, I have to vary different
parameters such as number of nodes, number of flows, number of packets per
second and measure some metrics and plot them in some graphs.
I also had to modify some mechanisms of Retransmission Timeout calculation
and compare the modified version with the original implementation of NS3.The
paper from which I have taken idea from is The Peak-Hopper: A New End-to-
End Retransmission Timer for Reliable Unicast Transport
